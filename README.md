# Re-Ex

This is an application to tracking personal revenue and expenses.

## Overview

- Re-Ex is a web application to keep track of personal - revenue and expenses.
- Re-Ex enables the user to add an entry, view all entries, edit and delete an entry.
- Re-Ex app has filters than enable the user to sort the entries by date created as well as in alphabetical order, both ascending and descending.
- The user can also search for an existing item.
- The user can also filter entries by category and type (revenue or expense).

### The challenge

- Had to implement the application with technologies I had little knowledge and experience in.
- Some components of the application had to be rushed because of time constraints.

## My process

- The Re-Ex api was created using express js which is a node js framework.
- Used mongodb as the database to persist the entries.
- Took advantage of mongoose library as middleware to create schemas and to interact which the mongodb database.
- Used jwt (json web token) to create an authorization token.
- Took advantage of MVC structure to modularize my project.
